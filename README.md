In work the user is able the earn mony by "working", by pressing the "work" button. This will reward the user with 100 dkk. The user can then transfer their earnings to their bank account by pressing the "bank" button. If the user has a loan and presses the "bank" button, 10% of the earnings will automatically go towards the loan with the remainder going to the balance. The "repay loan" button also appears if the user currently has a loan. Pressing this button will transfer all of the earnings towards the loan.

In the laptop section, the user can buy different laptops if their balance is efficient
